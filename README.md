# Keyboard-Randomizer-Malware
When put in the start up folder of a host computer with python, this script will randomize the users alphabetic input by deleting the character the user previously typed and instead typing a randomized letter. Kinda funny =)
Note: Please don't put this on anyone's computer. They might get mad.
